# Introduction

This book will teach you the basics of designing a web page with HTML and CSS. Whether you are an experienced programmer or not, this book is intended for everyone who wishes to learn to design a web page with HTML and CSS. To design a web page with HTML and CSS, you can follow these steps:

1. Start with a basic HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Page content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

1. Add the content that you want to display on the page, such as text, images, and links, using HTML elements.

```html
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="A description of the image">
  <a href="http://example.com">Click here to visit a website</a>
</body>
```

1. Use CSS to style the page and make it look the way you want. You can include the CSS in a separate file and link to it from the HTML, or you can include the CSS directly in the `head` of the HTML document.

```html
<head>
  <style>
    body {
      font-family: sans-serif;
      color: #333;
      background-color: #fff;
    }
    h1 {
      font-size: 32px;
      color: #333;
      margin: 0;
    }
    p {
      font-size: 16px;
      line-height: 1.5;
      margin: 0;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

1. Use responsive design techniques to make the page look good on different devices and screen sizes. This can involve using media queries to apply different styles based on the width of the viewport, using flexible layouts and images, and using responsive design frameworks such as Bootstrap.

```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
  h1 {
    font-size: 24px;
  }
}
```

By using HTML and CSS, you can create a wide range of web page designs and layouts. HTML provides the structure and content of the page, and CSS provides the style and layout. By combining these technologies, you can create beautiful and functional web pages that can be viewed on any device.
