# What is HTML?

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides a means to describe the structure of text-based information in a document by denoting certain text as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other types of content.

HTML uses "`tags`" to structure content. A tag is a piece of code that is inserted into the HTML document and is made up of a keyword surrounded by angle brackets. For example, the following code creates a paragraph element in HTML:

```javascript
<p>This is a paragraph</p> 
```

The opening `<p>` tag tells the browser that the text that follows is a paragraph, and the closing `</p>` tag tells the browser where the paragraph ends.

HTML is used to create and structure the content of a webpage. It is not a programming language and does not have the ability to create dynamic functionality. It is often used in conjunction with other languages such as JavaScript and CSS to create interactive and visually appealing websites.
