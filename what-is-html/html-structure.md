# HTML Structure

An HTML document has a basic structure that consists of a `head` and a `body`. The `head` contains information about the document, such as the `title`, and the `body` contains the actual content of the document.

Here is a basic example of the structure of an HTML document:

```javascript
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

The `<html>` element represents the root of the HTML document. Inside the `body`, you can add various types of content, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more. These are created using HTML tags. For example, the `<h1>` tag represents a level 1 heading and the `<p>` tag represents a paragraph.

It is important to use the correct structure and syntax when creating an HTML document, as this helps ensure that the document is properly displayed in the web browser.
