# HTML Syntax

HTML syntax refers to the set of rules that dictate how HTML elements should be written and structured in an HTML document.

Here are some basic rules for HTML syntax:

* HTML documents should start with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, which tells the browser that the document is an HTML5 document.
* The root element of an HTML document is `<html>`.
* The head of the document is contained within the `<head>` element.
* The body of the document is contained within the `<body>` element.
* HTML elements are represented by tags, which are keywords surrounded by angle brackets. For example, the `<p>` tag represents a paragraph element.
* Most HTML tags come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag. The closing tag is identical to the opening tag, but with a forward slash `(/)` before the tag name. For example, the &lt;p> tag has a corresponding closing tag of `</p>`.
* HTML tags are usually written in lowercase.
* HTML elements should be nested properly, with the innermost element being the first to be closed.

Here is an example of a simple HTML document that demonstrates these rules:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>This is my personal website, where I post my thoughts and ideas.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
