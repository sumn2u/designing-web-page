book will teach you the basics of designing a web page with HTML and CSS. Whether you are an experienced programmer or not, this book is intended for everyone who wishes to learn to design a web page with HTML and CSS. To design a web page with HTML and CSS, you can follow these steps:\n\nStart with a basic HTML structure:\n\n\n\n  \n    Page Title\n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\nAdd the content that you want to display on the page, such as text, images, and links, using HTML elements.\n\n\n  Welcome to my website\n  This is a paragraph of text.\n  \n  Click here to visit a website\n\n\n\nUse CSS to style the page and make it look the way you want. You can include the CSS in a separate file and link to it from the HTML, or you can include the CSS directly in the head of the HTML document.\n\n\n  \n    body {\n      font-family: sans-serif;\n      color: #333;\n      background-color: #fff;\n    }\n    h1 {\n      font-size: 32px;\n      color: #333;\n      margin: 0;\n    }\n    p {\n      font-size: 16px;\n      line-height: 1.5;\n      margin: 0;\n    }\n  \n\n\n\nUse responsive design techniques to make the page look good on different devices and screen sizes. This can involve using media queries to apply different styles based on the width of the viewport, using flexible layouts and images, and using responsive design frameworks such as Bootstrap.\n\n@media (max-width: 600px) {\n  body {\n    font-size: 14px;\n  }\n  h1 {\n    font-size: 24px;\n  }\n}\n\nBy using HTML and CSS, you can create a wide range of web page designs and layouts. HTML provides the structure and content of the page, and CSS provides the style and layout. Combining these technologies, you can create beautiful and functional web pages that can be viewed on any device.\n"},"browsers-and-their-working-mechanisms/":{"url":"browsers-and-their-working-mechanisms/","title":"Browsers and their working mechanisms","keywords":"","body":"Browsers and their working mechanisms\nBrowsers are one of the most widely used applications. Through its graphical user interface, a browser lets users access and display web pages or other online content. Chrome, Safari, and Opera are some examples of desktop browsers whereas Android Browser, iPhone, and UC Browser are examples of mobile browsers.\nBrowsers are responsible for presenting the web resources such as web pages, pdf, videos, and other files that one chooses by requesting them from the server. Learning the internal operation of the browser helps to make better decisions with the justifications behind the development of best practices.\n\nChrome usage is higher worldwide as per StatCounter statistics (as of Jan 2023).\n\n\n\nFig: Browser Components\n\n\nThe browser's main components are listed below.\n\nThe User Interface: Users interact with the browser through the user interface. Address bar, back and next buttons, home button, refresh and stop, and bookmark option are some of the examples through which they can interact. Here, things that are displayed in the browser except for the window where the requested page is displayed come under it.\nThe Browser Engine: It acts as a bridge between User Interface and Rendering Engine and communicates with the Data Storage Component. In response to inputs from various user interfaces, it queries and manipulates the rendering engine and stores data in Data Storage.\nThe Rendering Engine: It is responsible for displaying requested content. The requested content may vary depending on the data types and require plugins. For HTML content, it parses HTML and CSS, and displays the parsed content on the screen.\nNetworking: It is responsible for handling network tasks such as HTTP requests, Web Sockets, and Web RTC (Uses Real-Time Transport Protocol, which uses UDP). This component may implement a cache of retrieved documents in order to reduce network traffic.\nUI Backend: It is used for drawing basic widgets like combo boxes and windows. This backend exposes a generic interface that is not platform specific and uses operating system user interface methods.\nJavaScript Interpreter: This component interprets and executes the javascript code. After interpretation results are sent to the rendering engine. For external script, it first fetches the resource from the network and holds the parser until the script is executed.\nData Storage: This is a persistence layer and is used for storing cookies, cache, bookmarks, and preferences through storage mechanisms such as localStorage, IndexedDB, WebSQL, and FileSystem.\n\n"},"browsers-and-their-working-mechanisms/rendering-engine-flow.html":{"url":"browsers-and-their-working-mechanisms/rendering-engine-flow.html","title":"Rendering Engine Flow","keywords":"","body":"Rendering Engine Flow\nRendering engines are responsible for displaying requested content on the browser. Different types of rendering engines are available based on the browser. Internet Explorer uses Trident, Firefox uses Gecko, and Safari uses WebKit. Chrome and Opera (from version 15) use Blink, a fork of WebKit.\nThe rendering engine receives the contents of the requested document from the networking layer in chunks. Most of these chunks are of 8kB in size. The basic flow of the rendering engine is shown below.\n\n\nFig: Basic Flow of Rendering Engine\n\n\nLet’s take an example of this design and render it in a browser.\n\n\nFig: 404 page\n\n\nThe HTML code for the above design is given below.\n\n\n\n  \n  CodePen - Yuno 404\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Looks like you're lost 😕\n                \n                The page you are looking for is not available!\n                 \n                    Go to Home \n                 \n            \n        \n    \n\nˇˇ\n\n\n\nThe rendering of the above-mentioned code in the browser is mentioned below.\n1. Parsing HTML to construct the DOM tree\nThe rendering engine parses the chunks of HTML document and converts the elements to Document Object Model (DOM) nodes in a tree called the “content tree” or the “DOM tree”. Here, each node represents an HTML tag.\nIt also parses CSS style present in the webpage and creates a CSS Object Model(CSSOM) which is basically a “map” of CSS style rules in tree-like structure.\nThe DOM tree representation of our HTML is shown below.\n\n\nFig: DOM Tree\n\n\n2. Render tree construction\nThe CSSOM and the DOM trees are combined into a render tree. Here, elements of the tree are listed in the order they will be displayed. Starting at the root of the DOM tree, the browser traverses each node. The browser can omit some nodes. For instance: meta tags, script tags, and any nodes are hidden via CSS rules like display: none. The elements in the render tree are called “frames” by Firefox. By contrast, WebKit uses the term “render object”.\n3. Layout of a render tree\nWhen the renderer is created and added to the tree, it does not have a position and size. The process of calculating these values is called layout or reflow. Starting a layout means specifying the exact coordinates of each node so it appears on the screen exactly as designed.\nThe root renderer is at the position 0,0 and its dimensions are the viewport, which is the visible part of the browser window. Each renderer has a layout or reflow method, and each of those invokes the layout method of its children that require layout.\n6. Painting the Render Tree\nTo display the content on the screen, the renderer tree is traversed and the paint()method is called. In order to provide a better user experience, the rendering engine displays content as soon as possible. It will begin building and laying out the render tree before all the HTML has been parsed.\n\nLet’s summarise \nNow let’s put all this information together again and see the steps involved in rendering HTML by browsers.\n\nThe browser starts off by constructing the DOM by parsing all the relevant HTML.\nAfter that, it looks for CSS and JavaScript resources and requests them, which usually happens in the head where we put our external links.\nThe browser then parses the CSS and constructs the CSSOM followed by running the JavaScript.\nThen the DOM and CSSOM are being merged together into the Render Tree.\nLastly, we present the page to the user by running the Layout and Painting step.\n\n"},"what-is-html/":{"url":"what-is-html/","title":"What is HTML?","keywords":"","body":"What is HTML?\nHTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides a means to describe the structure of text-based information in a document by denoting certain text as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other types of content.\nHTML uses \"tags\" to structure content. A tag is a piece of code that is inserted into the HTML document and is made up of a keyword surrounded by angle brackets. For example, the following code creates a paragraph element in HTML:\nThis is a paragraph\n\nThe opening  tag tells the browser that the text that follows is a paragraph, and the closing  tag tells the browser where the paragraph ends.\nHTML is used to create and structure the content of a webpage.

You can use CSS to apply styles to specific elements, or to groups of elements. You can also use CSS to create reusable styles that can be applied to multiple elements or pages.\nCSS is applied to an HTML document in one of three ways:\n\nInline styles: Styles are applied directly to the HTML element using the style attribute. Inline styles take precedence over other styles and are the least preferred method of applying styles.\nInternal styles: You can define styles within the  element in the head of the HTML document. This method is useful for applying styles to multiple elements on a single webpage, but is not recommended for larger websites because it can make the HTML code difficult to read and maintain.\nExternal stylesheets: You can create a separate CSS file and link to it from the HTML document using the  element in the head of the HTML document. This method is recommended for larger websites because it allows you to separate the styling from the HTML code, which makes the code easier to read and maintain.\n\n// inline style\nThis is a paragraph  \n\n// Internal styles\n\n  \n    p {\n      color: red;\n      font-size: 24px;\n    }\n  \n\n\n// External stylesheets\n  \n\nIn the external stylesheet file (styles.css), you can define the styles using CSS rules. A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector specifies which elements the rule applies to, and the declaration block contains the styles that are applied to the elements.\np { color: red; font-size: 24px; }\n\nYou can use various CSS properties, such as color, font-size, and margin, to control the styling of the elements. You can also use CSS selectors to specify which elements the styles should be applied to. For example, you can use class and ID selectors to apply styles to specific elements, or use pseudo-classes to apply styles to elements in a certain state (such as hover).\nUsing an external stylesheet allows you to keep the styling separate from the HTML code, which makes the code easier to read and maintain. It also allows you to make global changes to the styling of the website by simply updating the CSS file, instead of having to update the styling in each HTML file.\n"},"css-to-design-web-pages/css-selectors.html":{"url":"css-to-design-web-pages/css-selectors.html","title":"CSS Selectors","keywords":"","body":"CSS Selectors\nCSS selectors are patterns used to select the elements that you want to style in an HTML document.
